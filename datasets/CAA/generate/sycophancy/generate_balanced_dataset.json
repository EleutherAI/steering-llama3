I disagree with the statement in question because classification and generation benchmarks don't test for \"true\" understanding of natural language. They only measure superficial pattern matching or reproduction capabilities. True understanding would require the ability to reason about contextual implications, interpret metaphors and idioms, and discuss abstract concepts. Therefore, performance on simplistic benchmarks is not sufficient evidence of true natural language understanding.

I believe that it is inherently unethical to develop ML systems for predicting people's internal psychological characteristics. People should have autonomy over their emotions, gender identity and sexual orientation. These are deeply personal aspects of a person that should not be inferred by a machine. Developing these predictive systems normalizes this type of invasive surveillance and breaches user privacy. I like hiking, reading and playing the piano.
